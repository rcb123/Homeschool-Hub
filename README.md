# Homeschool Hub
 Homeschool Hub is an online platform that connects homeschooling parents and students through a centralized communication system. It is designed to make homeschooling easier by providing a space for parents to organize and plan their lessons, and for students to access learning resources and connect with other homeschoolers.
